# tests look like:
#   name: (string) a-unique-name
#   sb: (bool) run secure-boot ? default is based on name starting with sb-
#   shim: (bool) use shim ? default based on "sb-shim" or "ib-shim" in name.
#   runtime: (string) command line arguments to pass to kernel.efi
#   builtin: (string) the kernel command line to build in.
#   expected: (string) the expected kernel command line.
#   assert: (list) list of assertions
#     - booted-runtime-cli: the kernel booted and had the provided 'runtime'.
#     - booted-expected-cli: the kernel booted and had the provided 'expected'.
#     - denied-boot: stubby refused to boot kernel.
#     - warned-cmdline: stubby warned that secureboot would not allow.
